  - there is also =agave-r.sfd= that does not include autohinting

- click File --> Generate Fonts --> pick TrueType, No Bitmap Fonts, No Rename --> Generate

** naming

- "Agave" refers either to the green plant or to the daughter of Kadmos in mythology.
- Agave is sister to [[https://github.com/agarick/autonoe][autonoe]] and [[https://github.com/agarick/ino][ino]].
- *type agaric* opted for a slightly eponymic name for their first typeface.
